OmDomDom is a small virtual DOM implementation. Use it to:

- Create virtual nodes from DOM strings
- Render those nodes to a page
- Reconcile changes between virtual nodes and patch the DOM

The library is intentionally very minimal. There isn't any special syntax for things like handlers, special attributes/properties, state management, or the like. Write your HTML and deliver virtual DOM any way you like.

Pull requests and issues welcome!

## Install

Use either npm or CDN.

**NPM**

```sh
$ npm i omdomdom
```

Then import its functions.

```js
import { render, update, create } from "omdomdom"

create(...)
render(...)
update(...)
```

OmDomDom uses only named exports, but you can always namespace them using an import wildcard:

```js
import * as omDom from "omdomdom"
omDom.create(...)
omDom.render(...)
omDom.update(...)
```

**CDN**

```html
<!-- The unminified bundle for development -->
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/omdomdom@0.1.13/dist/omdomdom.js"
  integrity="sha256-cXnjABuFPxuetQGlSNKTQdd2aHMBDL5V/ENBHOC7V4c="
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>

<!-- Minified/uglified bundle for production -->
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/omdomdom@0.1.13/dist/omdomdom.min.js"
  integrity="sha256-5O/m3zkhiKE+EAspr6OIbRAw1JOiV1LkTFL6dC/d0F8="
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

The CDN will make `OmDomDom` a property on `window`.

## API

You can do three things with OmDomDom: Create a vdom instance, render its nodes to a page, and patch it with updates.

### create()

To get started, pass your view to `create`.

```js
const view = "<p style='color: pink'>This is the start of something great.</p>"
const omNode = create(view)
```

`create` will check if your value is a string, then convert it to HTML using [`DOMParser`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser). The advantage of this route is `DOMParser` provides some decent error output if your HTML is incorrect.

You can optionally create the HTML yourself and provide that, if you prefer:

```js
const wrapper = document.createElement("div")
wrapper.innerHTML = view.trim()

const omNode = create(wrapper)
```

Either way, you will receive a virtual node tree structured like this:

```js
VirtualNode {
  // The tag name of the element.
  // If the element is a text node, "text" is used.
  // If the element is a comment node, "comment" is used.
  type: String,

  // An object whose key/value pairs are the attribute
  // name and value, respectively.
  attributes: Object.<name, value>,

  // Is set to `true` if a node is an `svg`, which lets OmDomDom
  // do special rendering operations for svg children.
  isSVGContext: Boolean,

  // The content of a "text" or "comment" node.
  content: String,

  // An array of virtual node children.
  children: Array<VirtualNode>,

  // The real DOM element.
  node: Node
}
```

### render()

Use `render` to insert your node somewhere on the page.

```js
render(omNode, document.getElementById("root"))
```

### update()

`update` requires you to have your initial virtual node tree, as that's the tree containing the document-appended nodes. Pass a new virtual node tree to compare and patch the original tree, and subsequently update the DOM.

```js
const nextView = "<p style='color: red'>I'm new and fresh.</p>"
update(create(nextView), omNode)
```

Do note that any virtual nodes created as the first argument to `update` are discarded. Again, the only virtual node tree you need to care about is the first one.

## Reconciliation

Reconciliation works similar to React and others, by comparing an older (live) virtual DOM tree to a new (template) one. The live tree is then patched with changes from the template.

### Keys

Use the `data-key` attribute on an element of it's in a list of elements. This ensures the node is preserved between renders, maintaining any event listeners, even if the number of sibling elements changes between updates.

The value for the attribute only needs to be unique among its sibling nodes.

In just about every way, keys behave in OmDomDom similar to the likes of other virtual DOM implementations.

### Events

Since the end result is real HTML, you should be able to use events like anywhere else.

It's worth noting that you won't be able to use tagged templates with OmDomDom. Nodes therefore need to be attached via vanilla JavaScript.

### Performance

If you think it can be improved, please contribute. :)

## Support

OmDomDom works in all modern browsers and IE11. It requires no polyfills/dependencies.
